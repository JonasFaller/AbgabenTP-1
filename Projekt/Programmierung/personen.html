				<div class="content">
					Cyrus Trask<br>The patriarch of the Trask family and the father of Adam and Charles. 
					Cyrus lies so convincingly about his military heroics during the Civil War that the government appoints him to a powerful

					lost his leg to amputation. Cyrus leaves his fortune of more than $100,000 to his sons.<br><br>

					in the Army.<br><br>
					Aron Trask<br>The son of Adam and Cathy and the twin brother of Cal. Aron is a goodhearted, trusting boy with deep, innate morality.

					that their mother is a prostitute, which leads Aron to join the army and die in World War I.<br><br>
