				<p class="aut">John Steinbeck was born on February 27, 1902 in the Salinas. He is of German-Irish origin. In 1919 he went to Stanford
				University in San Francisco to study literature and journalism, but he didnâ€™t like the study. More important to him are the part-time-jobs,
				with whom he finances his education. As it was in many of his novels, he works as a farmer, on construction sites and in factories. 
				To be a freelance writer, he moved 1925 to New York, but soon returned to California. His first three novels are ignored by critics 
				and audiences. It was only in 1935 that Tortilla Flat succeeded a breakthrough. Than Steinbeck worked as a journalist and described 
				the fate of the migrant workers during the Great Depression. His impressions of this time are incorporated into the two novels Mice and Men (1937) 
				and The Grapes of Wrath (1939). The latter becomes a huge success and makes Steinbeck the most famous author of the country. He gets also 
				condemned as a communist by the conspicuous side, because of the critique of capitalism which is expressed in the book. 
				During the Second World War, he was a soldier of war in Italy and in the years after he traveled through Europe, North Africa and Russia.
				With the novel East of Eden (1952) he makes once again a great success. Steinbeck, meanwhile married for the third time, travels with his 
				poodle Charley in a small truck through the USA and writes about this in the book Travels with Charley. In the same year he was awarded 
				the Nobel Prize for Literature. On December 20, 1968, he died of heart failure in New York.<br><br>


				Beyond Eden "is regarded as John Steinbeck's main work and was published in 1952. In the same year it was translated into German.
				All he had written before, he explained, was somehow only pre-exercise to this book, so it contained about everything he had, suffering 
				and prosperity, good and bad moods, evil and good thoughts, the pleasure of planning, some despair and the indescribable joy of creating. 
				The work is linked to its own family history. In 1955 it was filmed with James Dean in the lead role.<br><br><br><br>
