			<span class="popuptext2" id="myPopup2">A novel planned on the grandest possible scale.... One 
				of those occasions when a writer has aimed high and then summoned every ounce of energy, talent, 
				seriousness, and passion of which he was capable.... It is an entirely interesting and impressive book.
				<br>~New York Herald Tribune<br><br><br>Frank rated:<br><br>
				This book is mind blowing. It is John Steinbeck at his sharpest. He said that every author really only has one "book," 
				and that all of his books leading up to East of Eden were just practice--Eden would be his book.<br><br><br>
				umang rated:<br><br>This is a long, long sermon masquerading as a novel. Its aim seems clear- to be the great American novel. 
				In spite of, or maybe because of this overreach, it is completely unsatisfying. The characters are mere symbols. Most of the 
				themes pertain to the characters’ moral dilemmas, but it is difficult to be drawn into these since the characters lack 
				any real complexity.<br><br><br>My opinion:<br><br>For me the book was very interesting. You could build a good relationship to the character, 
				because John Steinbeck described them very well! You also got a good image from the place where it plays.<br>I don’t know the story from Cain and 
				Abel, so I don’t can say anything about this; how it refers to this book.<br>
				All together I could recommend it to other people.

			On this word you can click and you get to a new site. The book is divided in three parts: Author, action and characters. At the bottom from the book
