		<h3>PLOT:</h3>
		Our first family is the Trasks: there's Cyrus, a brief soldier for the Union who is obsessed with the army,
		and his two sons, Adam and Charles. Adam is the more beloved by his father, but Charles desires his father's love and doesn't get it. 
		Often he takes his anger out on Adam. Cyrus forces Adam into the military, while Charles stays home and takes over the farm. 
		After Cyrus's death, the brothers learn that Cyrus left them a large amount of money.<br><br>
		By chance Adam and Charles come across Cathy. Charles understands the kind of person she really is, but Adam builds her up into his perfect Eve. 
		He marries her and takes her to California, where he buys a nice big ranch. This is where Adam meets Samuel Hamilton, an Irish-American farmer with
		a large family, a heart of gold, and a lot of bad luck when it comes to making money. He and his family appear throughout the plot.<br><br>
		Cathy finds out that she is pregnant, but after giving birth to twin boys and she leaves to go be a prostitute in the town of Salinas. 
		The realization that Cathy is a completely different person than he imagined her shocks Adam and it takes him a while to recover. In the meantime, 
		the boys are raised by Adam's Chinese-American servant, Lee.<br><br>
		After the boys grew up, Adam moves the family to Salinas. Aron develops a relationship with his childhood crush, Abra. Adam clearly favours Aron.
		Aron can't stand the dirtiness of the world, and he also don’t care about his father's opinion of him. Cal, however, loves his father and wishes that 
		he would love him back. Cal also learns the truth about his mother (Adam had told the boys that she was dead), but doesn't tell it Aron.<br><br>
		When Adam loses most of his money, Cal decides to make it back and buy his father's love. He takes advantage of the U.S.'s entry into World War I and the 
		rising price of beans. When Aron is back home from college, Cal gives his father the money.<br><br>
		Far from being pleased, Adam is disappointed that Cal used the war to make a profit. In his anger and jealousy, 
		Cal tells Aron the truth about their mother. Aron can't handle the dirty truth, and recruit in the army. Finally, Aron is killed in the war, 
		and Adam suffers a major stroke that leaves him paralyzed. <br><br>

		<h3>PLACE:</h3>
		The book ‘East of Eden‘ is primarily set in Salinas Valley where John Steinbeck really grew up.
		The Salinas Valley lies along the Salinas River, longest river of the central coast of California (175miles). 
		This valley is between the Gabalin Ranges and San Lucia Range and touches part of Monterey Country. 
		In the southern part of California the rich land has earned the name „Americas’ Salad Bowl, 
		because lot of lettuce and other vegetables are grown there.<br><br>
		„I want to describe the Salinas Valley in detail but in sparse detail so that there can be a real 
		feeling of it. It should be sights and sounds, smells and colours but put down with simplicity as though
		the boys [his sons] were able to read it. This is the physical background of the book." 
		<br>~ John Steinbeck <br><br>

		<h3>TIME:</h3>
		The story is set between the beginning of the twentieth century and the end of World War 1.

		<h3>Major themes</h3>
		The book explores themes of depravity, beneficence, love. Also of the struggle for acceptance, greatness,
		the capacity for self-destruction and especially of guilt and freedom. It combines these themes together with 
		references to the biblical Book of Genesis (the story of Cain and Abel)<br>
		Steinbeck's inspiration for the novel comes from the fourth chapter of Genesis, verses one through sixteen, 
		which recounts the story of Cain and Abel. Also the title was chosen by Steinbeck from there: "And Cain went out 
		from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod, on the east of Eden" (verse 16, chapter 4)<br>
		You also will recognize that lot of names starts with the letters C and A because of the inspiration from Cain and Abel.

		<h3>Social context</h3>
		The novel follows the relationships of two families, the Trasks and Hamiltons.
		It is drawn heavily on the biblical stories of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel; 
		exploring the relationships between parents and children, between brothers and between people, 
		history and place. Steinbeck also wrote of the book: 'It has to have a universal quality, or there is no point in writing it.'<br>
		East of Eden also probes the nature of marriage and sexual love, through the person of one of Steinbeck's most memorable characters, 
		Cathy Ames, a wild, independent but amoral woman.<br><br>
		All together we can say it tells us about the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love and the murderous consequences of love’s absence.

		<h3>Writing style</h3>
		Steinbeck draws a very articulate image of the place in the mind of the reader by numerous references and 
		picturesque descriptions. He also describes the character in the book very well, so you can identify with them. The best example is Cathy Ames.<br>
		His writing style is inspired by the biblical Book of Genesis. He uses a lot of allusions. Per example:<br>
		•	Charles talks about a mark on his forehead (that reminded me of the mark of Cain)<br>
		•	Biblical phrases scattered throughout like “fruit of his loins”<br><br>
		Also the title is inspired from this biblical book.<br>
		John Steinbeck has completely mastered the art of showing instead of telling.  Nothing is a joy to read more than a story you figure out on your own.
